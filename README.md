# Nand2Tetris peoject


My own project, made with my bare (hands) keyboard.

thank you [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu) for introducing me to this project.

 
 - Please note: My code may look very immature or very messy. This is due to the fact that I just started learning Python during this project.
Maybe I'll do it for another project - to rewrite all this mess and turn it into a beautiful masterpiece...
